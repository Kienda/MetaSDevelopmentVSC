                    Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on
                    traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and
                    Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a
                    rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of
                    the day.
                    Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to
                    pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes
                    and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the
                    effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the
                    Mediterranean region.
